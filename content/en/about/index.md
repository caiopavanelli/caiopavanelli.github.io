### Who is Caio?

Hi there, I'm Caio Pavanelli and you're on my blog. I use this space to share ideas, opinions and tutorials about books and courses I take. Some worth mentioning topics about me are:

- I like to explore new technologies and develop solutions for different sets of problems.
- I have a [master's](https://repositorio.fei.edu.br/bitstream/FEI/279/1/fulltext.pdf) in Electrical Engineering at [Centro Universit√°rio da FEI](https://portal.fei.edu.br/) on [cognitive robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_robotics).
- I work on the creation of data platforms addressing the issues of separated storage and compute. This work brought me closer to Presto and Alluxio communities.
- I'm set to learn more about Cloud Architecture, Systems Design and Artificial Intelligence.
- I'm also interested in photography, guitar and writing as hobbies/side hustles.
